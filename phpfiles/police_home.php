        The prime duty of the police is to <strong>prevent crime and disorder</strong> and the police must recognize
        that the
        test of their efficiency is the absence of both and not the visible evidence of police action in dealing with
        them.
        The FIR is a very important document in the Indian criminal justice system. It ensures that all cognizable
        offences
        are investigated and that the accused persons are brought to justice. Police are a group of people whose job is
        to
        enforce laws, help with emergencies, solve crimes and protect property. Other than the district police forces,
        there can be various other departments under the state police, such as Criminal Investigation Department (CID),
        Economic Offences Wing (EOW), Telecom, VIP Security, Traffic police, Government Railway Police (GRP),
        Anti-Corruption Organization, State Armed Police Forces. The FIR needs to include the key details of the
        incident
        but does not require a fully detailed explanation. Upon receiving information about a cognizable crime, the
        officer
        in charge must immediately make an entry in the register and begin an investigation without delay. Forever,
        unless
        the police closes it if they find no substance in it or the court orders it to be closed for similar reasons.
        Though there are limitations on exercise of power by the High Court, yet that would not in any way suggest that
        High Court lacks the power. Officer-in-charge of a Police Station cannot cancel the FIR. SHO has no power to
        cancel
        the FIR.
